# CPRapp
An app that teaches CPR. This was the first time most of us had daddled in mobile development at all. We ran into a few bugs and mistakes, but this was an excellent first project to learn some mobile app and XML basics as well as how they relate to Java. This would be an ideal project to return to in the future and update. The app is broken up into two sections, a live CPR coaching section to use in the event of an emergency and a training section. We worked hard in collaboration and organization to complete as many parts of the app and conduct research on how to do a certain task. You can see our break down in the following Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDDy6R-wpHGHczzTQqOsFgMqp16hRu7PNiCdCLxQ0ME/edit?usp=sharing
